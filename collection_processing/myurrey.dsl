От автора
	Фразеологизм, или идиома, — это устойчивое выражение, значение которого не определяется отдельными значениями составляющих его слов.
	В настоящем словаре представлено более 900 русских фразеологизмов с их наиболее точными эквивалентами в британском варианте английского языка, а также около 1000 английских фразеологизмов с их русскими эквивалентами или, при отсутствии соответствующих русских идиом, переводом их значения. Русско-английская часть словаря снабжена дополнительно примерами употребления английских фразеологизмов в современном разговорном языке.
	Все фразеологизмы приводятся в алфавитном порядке. Для удобства поиска в качестве приложения к каждой части даются указатели, содержащие перечень всех включенных в эту часть фразеологизмов.
	Надеюсь, что словарь окажется полезным и удобным для всех, кто будет им пользоваться.
	Выражаю большую признательность Алану Мюррею за поддержку и помощь в подготовке этой книги.
